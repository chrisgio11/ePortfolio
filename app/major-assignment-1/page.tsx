  title: "Research Proposal",
  subtitle: "Major Assignment 1",
  description: "A comprehensive research proposal examining how course modality, online versus in-person, impacts students' development of rhetorical awareness in first-year writing.",
  course: "ENC 1102",
  date: "November 2024",
  outcomes: ["Information Literacy", "Research Genre Production", "Contributing Knowledge"],
  wordCount: "2,500 words",
  sources: "15+ academic sources",
  drafts: [
    {
      name: "Draft 1",
      description: "Initial research and outline with preliminary thesis",
      date: "November 5, 2024",
      link: "/artifacts/MA1.pdf",
      feedback: "Strong topic selection and good initial research. The thesis statement needs to be more specific and focused. Consider narrowing your scope to a particular aspect of digital privacy. Source integration could be improved with more direct quotes and analysis.",
      improvements: "Refined thesis statement to focus specifically on data collection practices of major social media platforms. Added more primary sources including recent case studies and user surveys. Improved source integration with better quote analysis and synthesis.",
      challenges: "Balancing breadth of research with depth of analysis, finding recent and relevant sources on rapidly evolving topic",
      learning: "Importance of having a clear, focused thesis early in the writing process"
    },
    {
      name: "Draft 2", 
      description: "Revised with peer feedback and instructor comments",
      date: "November 15, 2024",
      link: "/artifacts/MA1.pdf",
      feedback: "Much improved structure and argument development. The evidence is stronger, but you need to address counterarguments more thoroughly. Consider the benefits of social media data collection and why users might accept these practices. Your conclusion could be more compelling.",
      improvements: "Added a dedicated section addressing counterarguments about the benefits of targeted advertising and user convenience. Strengthened evidence with recent case studies including the Cambridge Analytica scandal and GDPR implementation. Enhanced conclusion with broader implications for digital citizenship.",
      challenges: "Finding balanced perspectives on controversial topic, incorporating counterarguments without weakening main argument",
      learning: "Value of peer feedback in identifying blind spots and strengthening arguments"

      name: "Final Draft",
      description: "Polished final version with comprehensive revisions",
      date: "November 25, 2024",
      link: "/artifacts/MA1.pdf",
      feedback: "Excellent synthesis of sources and compelling argument. The paper demonstrates strong research skills and thoughtful analysis. Your use of recent case studies and balanced perspective makes this a sophisticated piece of academic writing.",
      improvements: "Final polish on transitions between sections, enhanced introduction with compelling hook, refined conclusion with call to action for digital literacy education. Improved formatting and citation consistency.",
      challenges: "Ensuring all revisions maintained argument coherence, final editing for clarity and flow",
      learning: "How iterative revision leads to significantly stronger final product"

  reflection: "This research proposal gave me the opportunity to explore a topic that felt both personally meaningful and academically important: how the modality of a writing course (online vs. in-person) influences studentsâ€™ development of rhetorical awareness. Writing the proposal helped me think more critically about how different learning environments affect student engagement, especially in relation to audience, purpose, and context. It also taught me how to narrow a research question, design a feasible study under time constraints, and connect my personal observations to larger academic conversations. Planning out the timeline and designing survey questions showed me how complex even a small research study can be. This assignment helped me grow not just as a writer, but as a student researcher, and it gave me a much better appreciation for the behind-the-scenes planning that goes into academic inquiry.",
